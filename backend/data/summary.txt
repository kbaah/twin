I am a Full-Stack Software Engineer and AI Specialist with 13 years of combined experience, including 8+ years building scalable web and AI-enabled applications across healthcare, finance, insurance, and climate tech. Currently based in Accra, Ghana, I work as a Consultant AI Scientist delivering end-to-end solutions from experimentation to production deployment. I am well versed in AI and can serve as a forward deployed engineer, solutions architect, or full-stack developer who maximizes the use of AI to build intelligent, production-ready systems.

On the frontend, I have deep expertise in React, Next.js, Angular, and TypeScript, building high-performance, accessible enterprise UIs and optimizing production systems with tools like New Relic. On the backend, I build robust Python and FastAPI services for modern APIs and AI-driven systems, with additional experience in Node.js, Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB. I've delivered enterprise-grade solutions across multiple companies including The Weather Company, Groundspeed, Reset Health Clinics, and Guaranty Trust Bank.

I have extensive experience with low-code/no-code automation and data engineering, having led initiatives using Alteryx, Power Automate, PowerApps, Power BI, and Tableau to build ETL pipelines, automate workflows, and create executive dashboards. Early in my career as a Risk Data Analyst and Business Intelligence Analyst, I automated risk management reporting that reduced processing time from days to minutes and provided strategic insights for product discovery and profit maximization.

In AI and machine learning, I specialize in LLM engineering, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), fine-tuning open-source and frontier models, agentic workflows, prompt engineering, and inference optimization. I've delivered production AI projects including an MCP-powered customer support chatbot, an AI-driven orphanage research and recommendation platform, and a clinical documentation system leveraging speech-to-text, NLP, and summarization models.

My data science toolkit includes Python (pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, PyTorch), SQL, Spark, statistical modeling, machine learning (regression, classification, forecasting, clustering, recommendation systems), and cloud platforms (Azure, AWS, GCP). I also bring expertise in AI governance, model risk and controls, responsible AI practices, and cross-functional stakeholder engagement using Agile methodologies, Git/GitHub, and Jira.

I hold a Bachelor's degree in Actuarial Science from the University of Cape Coast and a Master's degree in Development Finance from the University of Ghana, where I graduated as Valedictorian and received the Best Graduate Award. I am an IBM Certified Data Scientist, IBM Certified Data Analyst, and Microsoft Certified AI Professional.

I am actively advancing my AI expertise through intensive training at the Vector Institute, Canada's premier AI research institution. I have completed their specialized bootcamps in Multimodal AI (October 2025), Agentic AI (September 2025), and Green AI and RAG (March 2025), gaining cutting-edge knowledge in the latest AI technologies, multimodal systems, autonomous agents, and sustainable AI practices. Additionally, I have completed comprehensive training in LLM Engineering and Generative AI covering prompt design, embeddings, RAG, fine-tuning, and production workflows; Agentic AI Engineering with autonomous agents, orchestration workflows, and tool integration; AI Strategy, Governance and Leadership for enterprise use cases and ROI-driven deployment; and production deployment of Generative and Agentic AI systems with end-to-end architecture, monitoring, and operational controls.

I am passionate about building intelligent, production-ready systems that create real-world impact, particularly in healthcare and finance where I see tremendous potential for AI transformation. I use Stoicism as a guiding philosophy in my work, which makes me a practical, solutions-oriented engineer. I'm also a strong communicator and public speaker who values knowledge sharing and helping others succeed, making me an effective team player and collaborator across technical and non-technical stakeholders.
